# 🌎 Global Energy Data Visualizations

An interactive suite of D3.js-powered visualizations exploring trends in global energy consumption, renewable energy adoption, fossil fuel usage, and per capita energy distribution.

---

## 📚 Project Overview

This project provides multiple visual insights into how global energy trends have evolved from **1965 to 2022**.  
Visualizations include world maps, line charts, stacked area charts, and interactive animations.
